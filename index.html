    <h2>One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,</h2>
    <h3>stands as a testament to the architectural brilliance and ambition of ancient Egypt .</h3>
    <h4>Built over 4,500 years ago during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu,</h4>
    <p>This colossal structure originally rose to a height of <strong>146.6 meters</strong>, though erosion has slightly reduced it over time.
        <br />
         Composed of millions of precisely cut limestone blocks,<strong> the pyramid</strong>  was constructed with astounding precision, aligning perfectly with cardinal directions.
        <br />
         Historians and engineers continue to marvel at how ancient builders managed such a feat without modern machinery.
        <br />
         Serving as a royal tomb, <strong>the Great Pyramid</strong> symbolizes <strong><em>the Egyptians'</em></strong> deep spiritual beliefs, particularly their quest for immortality.</p>
    <h5>Today, it remains an iconic landmark,</h5>
    <h6>drawing millions of visitors who stand in awe of its grandeur and mystery.</h6>
